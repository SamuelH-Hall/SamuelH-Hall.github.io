        <p>I am currently a student at the University of Louisville and will graduate in Winter of 2023 with a bachelor's degree in Computer Information Systems
            and a minor in Business Management. I possess skills in coding Python, C#, HTML, and Java. In addition to coding knowledge, I have over 9 years of experience
           in management at United Parcel Service. The goal of this portfolio is to showcase my skills in project managment, data analysis, and software development
           through course work I have completed in my college career.

        <H2>Portfolio</H2>
        <p>I host a repository of all on projects through github. The projects showcased reflect some of the course work during my time at the University of Louisville. 
            My portfolio also possesses some written documents that showcase some skills within project management through the website development project that we had done
            for Blue Ridge Animal Rescue. There are documents available for case studies that I had investigated for the technology failures that they had faced and the solutions
            I would implement to overcome the hardship these companies had faced.
